                <p>On this page I really like how it was designed, it was my favorite of the three, because it makes good use of what it has,
                     the titles with larger letters even in another color, then the text is well placed in the center without elements that distract to 
                     concentrate on the text, and as we advance on the page the title space disappears to concentrate 
                     more deeply on the text.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="boxtwo">
                <div class="Titletwo">
                    <h3>Fitts’s Law</h3>
                </div>

                <p>The second is similar to the previous one, because it also leaves its space divided
                     into parts such as the title, the images or the text, but unlike the previous one that 
                     was afraid to combine everything, here everything is separated or at least it feels 
                     like that, For example, the area of the title is too large to reach the content of
                      the text, I don't see it badly, but it is unnecessary, it could have been used better.</p>

                <p>This is the one that I like the least of the three because here it does everything wrong, 
                    you cannot move freely on the page, there is no organization in the sizes of the icons and 
                    when you try to read it is very uncomfortable due to the large number of movements that take 
                    place must do to read a simple sentence.</p>
